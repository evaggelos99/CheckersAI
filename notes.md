## Changes 1.1

* possible moves 
    * only allows 2 jumps this is wrong but its a start so i can get a minimum viable playable game
    * more jumps will be added
    * king promotion will happen aswell

* evaluation function 
    * is bare bones
    * paterns of checkers will be added later

* optimization 
    * this will be added when I have a better evaluation function and understand the game better and redo possible moves fun

## Changes 1.1.1

* Minimax
    * alphabeta prunning algorithm had some bugs didnt go to depth

* General
    * Player 1 doesnt play optimal for some reason don't know why. It could be because i switch the players and some bugs happen. Don't know where in code tho

## Changes 1.1.2

* possible moves
    * it allows 3 jumps which is the maximum you can jump

* bugs
    * goes out of bounds. Need to check my helper functions or maybe remake them cause some are not efficient -> this is gonna be done later who am I kidding ðŸ˜…

## Changes 1.1.3

* possible moves
    * bugs fixed
    * no more out of bounds
